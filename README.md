#### Disable Windows Hybrid Users v3
##### by KNEWYOUSIR

###### This script goes through a standard internal process for disabling users in
###### a windows hybrid domain environment using Active Directory (AD), Microsoft Graph (MG),
###### and ExchangeOnline (EXCH). I have tested and run this successfully only in Powershell 7
###### so far. This script requires to connect to MSGraph and ExchangeOnline before you run it.
###### Run Connect-MGGraph first, and then run Connect-ExchangeOnline afterwards.
